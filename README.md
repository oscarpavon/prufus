Select the .iso file and click on "Create bootable USB"
## Terminal
The graphics user interface just call a script who do the real work with two parameters, the .iso path and the device path like "/dev/sdb".
You can use that script directly from you PATH environment variable
Example:
```
sudo prufus.sh ./Downloads/Windows.iso /dev/sdb
```
# Development
If you want code navigation and code completation you can use clangd for your text editor
```
cd source_code
./generate_compile_commands.sh
```
This will generate a "compile_commands.json" file.
You need to open that text file and add the path where you are working like "/home/user/prufus/source_code/" in
```
"directory": ".",
```
replace the dot with the new path
